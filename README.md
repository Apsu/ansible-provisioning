Provisioning with Ansible
=========================

Ansible is a radically simple configuration-management, deployment, task-execution and multinode orchestration framework. Its modular design enables to extend core functionality with custom or specific needs.

This sub-project extends Ansible for provisioning so that orchestrating the installation of new systems is using the same methodology and processes as normal systems management. It includes modules for adding inventory information (facts) from external sources and modules for booting physical and virtual systems using (custom) boot media.
