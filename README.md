Provisioning with Ansible
=========================

Ansible is a radically simple configuration-management, deployment, task-execution, and multinode orchestration framework. Its modular design enables anyone to extend core for specific needs.

This sub-project extends Ansible for provisioning so that orchestrating the installation of new systems is using the same methodology and processes as normal systems management. Additionally, it includes modules for adding additional inventory information from external sources.
