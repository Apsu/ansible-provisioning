module: export
short_description: Export variables into host facts
description:
     - This module exports one or more variables (that may be local to a play)
       to a host's facts. This can be useful for debugging, or to work around
       a specific implementation limit.
     - In comparison to playbook variables, exported facts can be set
       conditionally (like any module) and are available in other plays.
     - The export module allows you to export prompt variables.
version_added: "1.2"
examples:
    - description: "Example exporting var1 and var2"
      code: 'action: export var1="something" var2="${inventory_hostname}-${var1}"'
