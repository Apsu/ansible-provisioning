module: global
short_description: Set global variables (aka host facts)
description:
     - This module sets one or more global variables. This can be useful
       for debugging, or to work around a specific implementation limit.
     - In comparison to variables defined in the playbook, global variables
       can be set conditionally (like any module) and are available in other
       plays.
     - The global module also allows you to 'export' prompt_vars to other
       plays in your playbook.
options:
  key_value:
    description:
      - the C(global) module takes key=value pairs as variables to set in the
        global scope
    required: true
    default: null
version_added: "1.2"
examples:
    - description: "Example global variables"
      code: 'action: global var="something" global_var="${local_var}"'
notes:
    - You can set local variables using the C(set) module.
